Your mental health matters. Be kind to yourself today.
It's okay to ask for help when you need it.
Your feelings are valid, but they don't define you.
Self-care isn't selfish, it's necessary.
Your worth isn't measured by your productivity.
Healing isn't linear, and that's perfectly normal.
You matter, even on the days when you don't feel like you do.
Taking breaks is part of taking care of yourself.
You're doing better than you think you are.
It's okay to not be okay sometimes.
