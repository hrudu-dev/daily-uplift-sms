Take a moment to breathe deeply and appreciate this moment.
You don't have to be perfect to be worthy of love and respect.
Remember to drink water and take short breaks throughout your day.
Progress isn't always visible, but that doesn't mean it's not happening.
Be proud of yourself for making it this far.
It's okay to set boundaries that protect your peace.
Focus on what you can control and let go of what you can't.
Every breath is a new beginning.
You are exactly where you need to be right now.
