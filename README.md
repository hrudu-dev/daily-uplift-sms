- **EventBridge**: Triggers Lambda function on a daily schedule.
- **Lambda**: Picks a random message and calls SNS.
- **SNS**: Publishes SMS to all subscribed phone numbers.

---

## How It Works

1. **Daily Trigger:** Amazon EventBridge invokes the Lambda function at a scheduled time each day.
2. **Message Selection:** Lambda retrieves the pool of positive messages/mental health tips, selects one at random.
3. **SMS Broadcast:** Lambda uses Amazon SNS to send the chosen message via SMS to all subscribers.
4. **Subscriber Experience:** Subscribers receive a single uplifting SMS dailyâ€”no apps, no logins, just encouragement!

---

## AWS Services Used

- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute to pick and send messages.
- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):** Sends SMS to subscribers.
- **Amazon EventBridge:** Schedules daily triggers for Lambda.
- **AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model):** For infrastructure as code deployment.

---

## Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Basic knowledge of Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-uplift-sms.git
   cd daily-uplift-sms
   ```

2. **Deploy the Application**
   ```sh
   cd deployment
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Subscribe Phone Numbers**
   ```sh
   aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <SNS_TOPIC_ARN> --protocol sms --notification-endpoint +1XXXXXXXXXX
   ```
   Replace `<SNS_TOPIC_ARN>` with the ARN from the deployment output and `+1XXXXXXXXXX` with the phone number.

4. **Test the Setup**
   ```sh
   aws lambda invoke --function-name daily-uplift-sms-UpliftLambdaFunction-XXXXXXXXXXXX response.json
   ```
   Replace the function name with the actual name from the deployment output.

---

## Adding or Updating Messages

Messages are organized in two ways:

**Option 1: Edit Lambda Function**
1. Edit the `MESSAGES` dictionary in `src/lambda_function.py`
2. Redeploy the application:
   ```sh
   cd deployment
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

**Option 2: Use Message Files**
1. Edit files in `messages/` directory:
   - `motivation.txt`
   - `mental_health.txt` 
   - `mindfulness.txt`
2. Each line is a separate message

---

## IST Timezone Support

The application now supports Indian Standard Time (IST) for proper scheduling:

**IST Utilities:**
```python
from ist_utils import get_ist_time, format_ist_time, is_business_hours

# Get current IST time
ist_now = get_ist_time()

# Format as readable string
time_str = format_ist_time()  # "Monday, 23 June 2025 12:43:11 IST"

# Check business hours (9 AM - 6 PM IST)
if is_business_hours():
    send_message()
```

**Lambda Environment:**
All timestamps and analytics use IST timezone automatically.

---

## MCP Server

Real-time monitoring server for development and testing:

**Start MCP Server:**
```sh
python simple-mcp.py
```

**Available Commands:**
- `time` - Get current IST time
- `stats` - Get SMS statistics
- `quit` - Exit server

**Example:**
```
> time
IST Time: Monday, 23 June 2025 12:43:11 IST

> stats
{
  "total_subscribers": 150,
  "messages_sent_today": 150,
  "categories": ["motivation", "mental_health", "mindfulness"]
}
```

---

## Web Dashboard

Admin interface for managing subscribers and viewing analytics:

**Features:**
- View subscriber statistics
- Add/remove subscribers
- Send custom messages
- View message analytics charts
- Real-time IST time display

**Access:**
1. Deploy the application
2. Open the API Gateway URL in browser
3. Or serve locally: `cd src/static && python -m http.server 8000`

---

## Customization

- **Change Frequency:** Edit the `ScheduleExpression` parameter in `deploy.sh` to change when messages are sent.
- **Personalized Messages:** Modify the Lambda function to support user preferences or custom message pools.
- **Analytics:** Add logging or integrate with CloudWatch for delivery stats.
- **Opt-In/Out:** Add API endpoints for users to subscribe/unsubscribe.
